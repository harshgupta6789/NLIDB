Hindi Natural Language Interface to SQL Database

This project implements a Natural Language Interface to Databases (NLIDB) system that converts Hindi text and voice queries into SQL commands. Leveraging Paninian Grammar and dependency parsing with StanfordNLP, it achieves 87.5% accuracy in generating SQL SELECT queries. The system includes a Flutter-based frontend app and a Django REST API backend, enabling non-English speakers to easily interact with relational databases through natural Hindi language input.
